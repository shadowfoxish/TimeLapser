# TimeLapser
Basic time lapse application for use with webcams

## Dependencies
Uses AForge webcam library via nuget package

## Code Note
I threw this together in a few hours on a Sunday. It does not use best practices for application design. It just does what it needs to.

## Other stuff
The default "shadow fox" place holder image is a 3DCG rendering by user X-2, on Pixiv. I'll probably change that eventually
